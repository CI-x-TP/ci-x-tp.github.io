    <h2>About</h2>

    <p><strong>How can our understanding of collective intelligence inform tech policy?</strong></p>

    <p>Tech(nology) policy involves creating regulations and guidelines to ensure that technological innovation benefits society and systemic risks are mitigated. Contemporary tech policy issues include how to regulate and reform social media platforms, and how to responsibly develop and govern advanced artificial intelligence. Successfully handling such issues demands an understanding of how micro-level interactions and network dynamics translate into collective, macro-level outcomes. This suggests that the collective intelligence research community—with its grounding in notions of complexity and scalability—is uniquely well-positioned to contribute to tech policy. In this half-day, interactive workshop, participants will  recognize how collective intelligence research is pertinent to current tech policy issues,  and identify how failures to incorporate complexity can undermine consensus formation and evidence-based policy. In addition, participants will collaboratively identify collective-intelligence-inspired policy recommendations and learn about the policy levers through which they can engage with policymakers.</p>
